      <!-- <b style=" color: red;font-size: 15px;">Based on your feedback of clashes with other exams and not being able to write NPTEL exams on a weekday (Aug 19th) we worked with our exam partner and were able to change the exam date from 19 Aug 2021 to August 22, 2021 (Sunday). Many of you may have chosen for refund or to write the exam on Aug 19 by filling the form we had circulated. But we need your response/choice again for the new exam date of Aug 22, Sunday as the date may be more convenient for you to write the exam and hence you may not want a refund</b>
        <br><br>
          <b>Choose between the two options given below:</b>
          <b style="color: blue"><p>Use this form to

            <li> If you wish to cancel the exam, choose the "Cancel and refund" option. This can be done individually for every course you have registered.</li>
            <li>80% of the exam fee paid by you will be refunded. Refund will be initiated within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Page 2 has the 3 choices for exam city. If you wish to change from current choice given, please change using this.

           <b>Dear learner</b><br><br>
           <p>Hope you are safe and doing fine in the current situation.</p>
           <p>This is with regard to the Jan-Apr 2020 NPTEL exams. Based on the feedback received the last couple of days from several stakeholders such as learners, colleges, etc, we have decided on the following:</p>

           <b style="color: blue">Cancelling the exams scheduled for 23/24/25 June through TCS</b>
           <p>The exams scheduled on 23/24/25 June, stand cancelled and the choices learners had opted for - In person exams or Refund, stand cancelled.</p>
           <b style="color: blue">1. Attested Assignment Score sheet:  For ALL exam registered candidates:</b>
           <p >We will issue an attested assignment score sheet letter, regardless of your assignment score - which can be used as appropriate.</p>
           <b style="color: blue">2. Modified Pass certificate: Based on Average Assignment score</b>
           <p>We will calculate the Average Assignment score as follows:</p>
           <p>- Average of the best 3/6/8 assignments for courses of duration 4/8/12 weeks (or as announced apriori in the course in case of changes)</p>
           <p>- If this score >= 40/100 (which is also one condition for certificate eligibility), we will issue a modified Pass certificate.</p>
           <p>- If this score < 40/100, this certificate will not be issued.</p>
           <br>
           <p>This certificate will not be counted towards the Domain certification as a completed course. Similarly, we will not be issuing an AICTE-NPTEL FDP certificate also based on this.</p>
           <b style="color: blue">3. A generic letter from our side - request to College authorities to accept this as per their requirement will be put up on nptel.ac.in, can be downloaded and used</b>
           <p>We will put up a pdf in which we will explain the assignment score sheet and the Pass certificate and request them to accept and process further. We will also independently approach the ministry, AICTE and UGC to convey this new process for Jan 2020 semester to all universities.  </p>
           <b style="color: blue">Regarding the conduct of exams in future:</b>
           <p>Independent of the Pass certificate and the Attested assignment score sheet mentioned above, in order to plan for a possible exam sometime in the future, we will share another form after the above activities are completed, with 2 choices:</p>
           <ol type="a">
             <li><b>a. Cancel and refund -</b> Those who are very sure that they would not want to appear for regular proctored NPTEL exams and want a refund - can choose this. We will refund the money. We may not be able to open registrations again in this case if you wish to appear for it later.</li>
             <li><b>b. NPTEL can retain fees for exams whenever organized for Jan 2020 courses </b>-Those who would like to wait and take the exam with us - whenever we conduct it - can opt for this choice  and we will keep the fees with us. Writing this and passing as per the certification criteria laid down will get them the regular NPTEL certificate. This will alone be counted towards the Domain certificate and issue of the FDP certificate.</li>
           </ol>
          <div>
              <p>The mode of conducting the exams, date of the exams, etc - we will inform as the situation evolves.  <br>
